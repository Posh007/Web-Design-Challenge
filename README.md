## Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

## Instructions

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations that were created in a past assignment, plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

### Website - Fulfilled Requirements

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages]
* A ["Comparisons" page]
* A ["Data" page]

* The dashboard can be view [here](https://posh007.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/Web%20Visualization/index.html)!

### Bonus

* A different weather dataset was used for the bonus section! 
* Extra color and visualizations for comparison were added.
